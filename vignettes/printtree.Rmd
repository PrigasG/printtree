```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(printtree)
```

## Basic Usage

Print the tree for current working directory

```{r}
print_rtree()
```

## Printing an RStudio project

If the directory (or one of its parents) contains a .Rproj file, you can choose how to treat that:

```{r}
# project = "none": just print from the provided folder

# project = "auto": use the folder as-is (no upward search)

# project = "root": walk upward to find a .Rproj and print from that root

```

## Common Options

```{r}
print_rtree(max_depth = 2)
print_rtree(show_hidden = TRUE, max_depth = 2)
print_rtree(format = "unicode", max_depth = 2)
```
