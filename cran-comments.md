## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have:
- Added a reference in DESCRIPTION and quoted software names in single quotes.
- Replaced commented-out examples with runnable examples using a temporary directory.


## New submission
This is a new submission of the package `printtree`.

## Summary
`printtree` prints a compact directory tree for R projects or any folder. It can optionally
detect project roots (e.g., via `.Rproj` or `DESCRIPTION`) and print from the root. 
It also supports optional PNG snapshot export of the printed tree.

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse dependencies
This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
